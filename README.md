Objective: 
Protect your base by destroying the zombie waves with turrets and by shooting them yourself. 

 Ants vs Zombies is a 2D turret defense game where the player (Peter the Anteater) can move and place a variety of anteater 
turrets which shoot ant bullets, each with their own attributes towards the oncoming wave of zombies. Ant bullets will damage the zombies, 
eventually killing them when their health reaches 0. Zombies are able to damage and destroy these ant turrets as well as the player 
when in contact with them. If the wave of zombies reaches the endline or the player health reaches 0, the game is over as the zombies have 
infiltrated the Mesa Court Base. There are six types of anteater turrets and ant bullets, being standard, fire, ice, electric, earth, and homing. 
On one hand, bullets have special effects and different properties including speed, damage, and more. On the other hand, turrets shoot these bullets, but
also apply an AOE effect that can either benefit or harm you along the way. In addition, you must first unlock these special bullets and turrets, and you do
so by clearing two waves, with a new power up being rewarded on the third wave after, so make sure to look at your new turrets and bullets as you clear more
levels. Finally, while bullets can be used infinitely, you must buy turrets in order to place them, getting money from killing zombies. Moreover, turrets cannot
be placed next to one another, making them take up a 3 by 3 grid area. In addition, there is a new co-op mode for 2 player local play in which each player controls
one half of the map. Lastly, our final mode, the versus mode, pits the player versus a computer Peter to see which person can last longer in an endless amount of waves.
Now, it is time to get out there and clear as many waves as it takes to stop the zombies march into our Anteater territory!

Co-op Mode:
- Players share health and money
- Prices for turrets are increased
- More mobs spawn per wave
- Each player controls one half of the map

Versus Mode:
- Player and AI have separate health and money
- Last wave is endless
- If the AI dies, you win, if you die, the AI wins
